                         'queue-based battle system, which is a twist on a '
                         'classical turn-based RPG battle system. Instead of '
                         'dividing the game in turns, and having each '
                         'character act as a reaction to what happened '
                         'previously, the flow of battle is divided into '
                         'chunks of time represented as Time Points. At the '
                         'start of a turn, each character is assigned the same '
                         'amount of Time Points, and based on it they can '
                         'queue-up a certain amount of actions to execute. '
                         'Once all the actions have been queued up, characters '
                         'execute the queued-up actions based on their '
                         'combined order. Each battle action is shown as a '
                         'dynamically generated panel, based on the the '
                         'characters that are present in the action, and which '
                         'action was selected for them. The game stores each '
                         'of the generated panels so that it could create new '
                         'manga pages at the end of the battle. As the players '
                         'are tasked with deciding the action upfront, they '
                         'would not be reacting to the battle’s flow, instead '
                         'they would be directing it, giving them the feeling '
                         'of being a Battle Director for a Manga. At the end '
                         'of the battle, the game generates new manga pages '
                         'using the dynamically generated panels throughout '
