    "about_the_game": "A world devastated by past wars is threatened once again. When a former comrade asks for help, Happy the Robot reluctantly agrees to face Layla \u2014 once a friend, now a dangerous enemy they thought they had destroyed. The mission: ascend Layla\u2019s tower and destroy the last copy of her consciousness before she can be downloaded into a new body and enact her devious plan. <br><br>Monochrome Heights is a tough-as-nails 2D platformer featuring classic run, jump, and slide mechanics \u2014 but most importantly, a distinctive color-swapping mechanic that involves phasing between black and white platforms to climb the tower. With crisp pixel art and a modern retro-style experience, the game is inspired by early Super Mario Bros. and Mega Man titles. <br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A novel color-swapping mechanic called phasing, where the player must swap Happy's color between black and white to land on platforms of that same color.<br></li><li>Run, jump, and slide through difficult traps and hazards to reach the top of the tower. <br></li><li>A narrative-driven Story Mode consisting of 40 challenging levels with a wide variety of hazards and obstacles.<br></li><li>Additional unique levels in Record Mode, allowing players to set their best time, and try to beat the devs; also featuring every level unlocked in Story Mode.<br></li><li>Robots.
