    "about_the_game": "Welcome to <strong>ATGANGA: Spectacle for the Gods</strong>, a 4-player local party fighter with draft mechanics that will keep you on your toes with every new game. Challenge your friends in battle as the norse gods watch and judge your every move. The gods will bare gifts for you to draft. Pick strategically and build your arsenal of powers and abilities to end up as the final viking standing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Gameplay</h2>Every player starts powerless and weak, with only a spear and bag full of rocks. Using this rudimentary toolset will be important but with the right gifts from the gods anything can happen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Draft</h2>Drafting new items will give you a unique set of powers to help you fight and win over your foes. It will be no easy task, as the fickle gods will try to skew the match in favor of the underdog. Learn as you play and discover new synergies that can lead you to victory. As the match goes on the gods will dig deeper among their treasures and give more rare and potentially legendary items.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2403380/extras/draft-smaller.gif?t=1682518509\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Abilities</h2>Each god is willing to lend you a part of their power through enchanted items. The path you take will determine what type of warrior you are. Will you follow Odin the all-father, Thor the thunderous brute, Loki the trickster, Hel the ruler of the underworld, Njord the ocean watcher, Skadi the huntress, or will you take your own path and combine their powers to become something completely new?<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2403380/extras/action-smaller.gif?t=1682518509\" />",
