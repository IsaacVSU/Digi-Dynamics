                         'queue-based battle system, which is a twist on a '
                         'classical turn-based RPG battle system. Instead of '
                         'dividing the game in turns, and having each '
                         'character act as a reaction to what happened '
                         'previously, the flow of battle is divided into '
                         'chunks of time represented as Time Points. At the '
                         'start of a turn, each character is assigned the same '
                         'amount of Time Points, and based on it they can '
                         'queue-up a certain amount of actions to execute. '
                         'Once all the actions have been queued up, characters '
                         'execute the queued-up actions based on their '
                         'combined order. Each battle action is shown as a '
                         'dynamically generated panel, based on the the '
                         'characters that are present in the action, and which '
                         'action was selected for them. The game stores each '
                         'of the generated panels so that it could create new '
                         'manga pages at the end of the battle. As the players '
                         'are tasked with deciding the action upfront, they '
                         'would not be reacting to the battle’s flow, instead '
                         'they would be directing it, giving them the feeling '
                         'of being a Battle Director for a Manga. At the end '
                         'of the battle, the game generates new manga pages '
                         'using the dynamically generated panels throughout '
                         'the battle and adding it to the story pages allowing '

                         'tools for it. Chess Graphy was made to help you look '
                         'through the lines of different openings and see '
                         "visually every move on a board. You don't have to "
                         'navigate through a long and complex text of moves '
                         'anymore. Just open up Chess Graphy, load your '
                         'favorite opening and we will do the rest for you.How '
                         'does Chess Graphy work?For smooth user experience '
                         'Chess Graphy provides a clear and simple interface. '
                         'After opening the program, you will be given an '
                         'empty board. By entering Edit Mode and selecting the '
                         'main board, further moves and positions can be added '
                         'to the graph. The boards can be flipped and named '
                         "before or after you've created them. Upon finishing "
                         'your work you can save the current state of your '
                         'graph into a (.cgraph) file. If you want to load and '
                         'revise your openings, you can hit the load button '
                         'and select the file you want to learn.Why is it '
                         'beneficial for you?Chess Graphy is the one of the '
                         'most user-friendly program on the market. Instead of '
                         'learning your openings from a PGN file, which is '
                         'hard to navigate, you can easily load your openings '
                         'into Chess Graphy and see all the moves in a flow '
                         'chart. By being able to see every position, it is '
                         'much easier to learn the moves from photographic '
                         'memory. Playing everything out on one chessboard is '
                         'simply not best way anymore.How to work with the '
                         'program?Moving around the grid is by using the right '
                         'click on the mouse and dragging your cursor around. '
                         'This is because left clicking on the boards is used '
                         'to open them. After entering Edit Mode left clicking '
                         'on them will load the position into the Editor, '
                         'where you can perform the moves. There are no limits '
                         'in the Editor, you can move or take any piece '
                         'anywhere you want. Clicking on a loaded board will '
                         "open/close its subpositions, so it's also possible "
                         'to navigate through the graph in the Editor. Now '
