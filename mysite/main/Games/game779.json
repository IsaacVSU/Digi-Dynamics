        "notes": "The game is centred around running a tavern and brewing ales, therefore alcohol is a main theme of the game. The historical setting means that language may be mature in nature and criminality is a common element of the game world. There are no scenes of nudity or sexual acts in the game however there are romance options including use of suggestive (but not sexually explicit) language."
