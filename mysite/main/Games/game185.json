    "about_the_game": "When insurance companies dodge the responsibility, it\u2019s up to you to save your daughter\u2019s life. This will require some dirty work and shady clientele, but you have no other choice, right? When the big boss calls once again, bring a bucket and a mop cause you will really need them. Are you up for the challenge?<br><br>You need nerves of steel to clean crime scenes left behind by major and minor criminals. You may not have money for your daughter\u2019s hospital stays, but what you do have is a very particular set of skills. With the help of an entire arsenal of equipment, you will clean blood, pack up bodies and remove any odor. All this under the pressure of a ticking clock and police breathing down your neck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Deep Clean - Grab your trusty mop and sponge. They will be handy for the majority of the missions. And when the mess becomes too much whip out the powerwasher and deep clean outside spaces. Or when the smell is a bit too strong you have more than just an odor eliminator.<br></li><li>Arm\u2019s Race - Sometimes the equipment you have is not enough and needs an extra oomph. If your lamps or flashlights are not strong enough, get new ones! If there will be too much blood outside, get a different set of power washer nozzles! So before every mission, check your storage and inventory, you may need something stronger and better.<br></li><li>Deep Pockets - Make money in any way you can! Mobsters are known for being generous, but sometimes that\u2019s not enough. And certain objects may be too tempting. Who is going to miss this expensive watch? The owner\u2019s already dead.<br></li><li>It\u2019s about Family - With all the gruesome things you will see and do on every job, you must not forget that you are doing this for her. The life of a single father has its challenges and you need to overcome them all.</li></ul>",
