Our goal? Simply to rival big games like Quaver. Think it's tough? Think again, because this is hands down the coolest 5K rhythm game around (maybe, most likely\u2026 probably. uh)<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2734590/extras/customize.png?t=1705424274\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CUSTOMIZE\u2026 EVERYTHING?!</strong></h2>We were all about making Poly Beats tailor to you from the start. Personalize your experience with custom keybinds, maps, colors, and note effects. But we're not stopping there \u2013 dive into the world of Steam Workshop, where players worldwide can effortlessly share and access custom maps and themes.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2734590/extras/stream.png?t=1705424274\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STREAM!</strong></h2>For our casual players, we've got something special \u2013 Stream! Our in-house system lets map creators go wild with decorations, like rotational light rays and custom shaders! Crazy stuff, right? Plus, it's super easy with our in-game Stream! Editor. Just lay down the original Chart-Map, and we're good to go!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2734590/extras/ragstoriches.png?t=1705424274\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>INNOVATIVE GAMEMODES</strong></h2>Check out our 'Rags To Riches' gamemode. Receive songs from other players and aim to outdo the previous player within a set time. Climb the Poly Beats League ladder and earn those Skill Points!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2734590/extras/divisions.png?t=1705424274\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>RANKED DIVISIONS</strong></h2>If you're hungry for more competition, try Ranked Divisions. Collect Skill Points in Freeplay mode to move up divisions, from Feather III to Elite I!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2734590/extras/collabs.png?t=1705424274\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TUNE PACKS + ARTIST COLLABS</strong></h2>We want to actually consistently give songs to our community, unlike games like osu!, where you rely on only the community after the tutorial. We intend to make official OSTs for all our players who regularly want new challenges, and make sure to keep an eye on the \u2018Extras\u2019 pack, as this is updated regularly! &lt;3<br><br>We're not just about our songs \u2013 we collaborate with other artists too!  Get ready for diverse tune packs, and don't worry, we won't make you go broke. (Seriously, no EA pricing here.)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GENEROUS REVENUE MODEL</strong></h2>Best part? Poly Beats is free! Enjoy base game content, customizations, and maps without spending a dime. But, there might be some DLCs down the road \u2013 5th Step's gotta make a little bread, you know.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GET IT NOW, FOOL</strong></h2>Thanks for reading about our game! If you made it this far, I'm sure you wanna play\u2026 so what are you waiting for? Wishlist this thing, and we'll catch you on release day! :)",
