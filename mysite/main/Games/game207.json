With your assistance, he'll pop and lock on a treacherous journey across multiple landscapes, confronting the finest dancers they can muster.

Thus, Charles juggles the world of dance with his day job, gathering pollen to fund entry into esteemed dance clubs and to dress himself in eye-catching attire. Can you have an adventure without a love interest? Yes, you could. But this adventure one has one anyway! Charles has been desperately trying to impress Beeanna, a girl (bee) from his hive. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2636590/extras/Mods.png?t=1696825981\" /><br>Custom Song?
