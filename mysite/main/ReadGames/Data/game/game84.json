To survive, you must think on the fly, switching off of depleted elements and engaging the enemy with fresh magic. Each shard you uncover adds new options and new utility to your arsenal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plan your Path</h2>Take advantage of a unique form of progression in the form of pseudo-randomized skill trees. Locate the key abilities in each Shard's skill tree, seek out key special abilities, and use dark blessings to manipulate the tree in your favor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Devastating Synergy</h2>While a Shard can be powerful on its own, they are even stronger in concert. Bolster your minions with healing, cascade a devastating blow across an entire army, or wall off enemies inside an inferno: these are just a few of the options available to discover.",
