An untold horror haunts these lonely trails, stalking your every move. Each ascending step brings you closer to your goal and even closer to death. And die you shall, more than once, in your quest to explore further, hide more effectively and master sliding. <br><br>ALPEN GHOUL is an exploration/stealth game. Your goal is to reach the summit alive, but you are not alone. You are being hunted by a creature roaming the same paths you do.

The price of a speedy descent is high, however, since you won\u2019t just leave behind the creature\u2026 but some of your progress as well.
