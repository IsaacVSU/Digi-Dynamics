    "about_the_game": "In The Chalice of Illusion, puzzles, enemies, dialogue, visuals, sound and more are all alike governed by a single supernatural order of hexing form sigils. This world will be presented to you with no restrictions, context or introduction. You will be gently nudged out of your confusion by subtle, tasteful, unobtrusive design that pushes you into figuring out everything by yourself. <br><br>This is a game that emphasizes the memorable experiences found in guessing and testing out assumptions about the unfamiliar. Hardcoded requirements are used sparingly, so as to prioritize the sort of autonomy that enables the player's curiosity and sense of discovery. Difficulty gates are favored over insurmountable roadblocks. Dialogue trees have no hidden arbitrary flags or requirements to their possible alternatives, only begging that you understand their context well enough to find what you yourself might want to get out of navigating them.
