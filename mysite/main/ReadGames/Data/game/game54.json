    "about_the_game": "Echoes of Fear invites you to unravel ancient mysteries beneath the tranquil facade of a valley frozen in time. Engage with a series of cryptic riddles, guiding your steps through a series of haunting houses, each hiding secrets that echo through the ages. Can you decipher the enigmatic clues and escape the eerie enigma that shrouds the valley?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore the breathtaking Valley, take in the beautiful scenery while at the same time gathering clues to help determine the final location of the Artifact. Each house you enter contains paranormal encounters in one way or another.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Hostile Wildlife - Wolves roam the map and they are very sneaky, you will need to keep your head on a swivel when you are out roaming around.<br />\r\n* The Guardian - The Artifact is guarded by a creature that will chase you upon seeing you. You can outrun it, but beware, you have limited Stamina.<br />\r\n* Torch Drain - You have your trusty torch at your disposal to help you once the sun sets. Be careful though, the battery drains in 2 minutes and takes 3 times as long to fully recharge.<br />\r\n* Stamina - Sprinting in this game sometimes is a must, especially when being chased. Obstacles are your best friend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow long will you last in Echoe's of Fear? For if you die, its game over. With no weapons to defend yourself, you must use your wits to survive!",
