Killing the enemy hero is enough for victory but minions shall do everything possible to prevent this from happening, resulting in ever-changing dynamics never seen in any other game.<br>Different playing styles and squad compositions allow for tank heroes to soak up damage, high mobility heroes for hit-and-run tactics, heal and support heroes for enhanced minion effectiveness and much more.<br>Additional settings allow for up to 3 heroes per squad simultaneously, for experienced players who prefer even higher complexity.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2336810/extras/1t.png?t=1702245782\" /><br><br><br><u><strong>Positioning and Orientation</strong></u><br>Increase hit chance when flanking or backstabbing, block with shields and spells to reduce damage taken from frontal attacks.

Some skills have unique effects against engaging or engaged units.<br>Ranged units get a significant damage penalty for being engaged.<br>Units will disengage after taking damage from any unit except the engaged unit. In a well-coordinated squad, units will protect each other and prevent them from getting engaged.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2336810/extras/4t.png?t=1702245782\" /><br><br><br><u><strong>Stability and Momentum</strong></u><br>Units start the game with full Stability and will drop by performing offensive actions or taking Stability Damage from enemies. All units recover 1 Stability per turn, and Heroes can rest, spending an entire turn to fully recover it.<br>Stability also provides resistance to damage and being pushed or pulled. Hit hard when your enemies are on low on Stability to make the most damage, but be mindful of not getting your Stability too low, specially when your enemies are well positioned for attack.<br><br>Units start the game with no Momentum and it\u2019s gained by using most basic actions. Higher Momentum enables more powerful skills, but the most powerful ones will decrease Momentum after use.<br>Heroes can also use the \u201cRally\u201d ability to increase Momentum of a friendly minion.<br>Some special attacks and spells can do Momentum Damage to enemies, to prevent them from using advanced skills.<br><br>Rather than being linear, both Stability and Momentum will wildly fluctuate up and down. This will dictate when it\u2019s time to play defensive and when it\u2019s time to go all-in, learning to read the tides is key to victory.<br><br><br><u><strong>Upgrades</strong></u><br>Dealing damage with any unit grants Upgrade Points.<br>After reaching a certain amount of Upgrade Points, you can Upgrade any Hero or Minion during its turn.<br>All Minions can choose to Upgrade into one out of three different specializations, once chosen it stays the same for the entire match.<br>Heroes get a wide variety of Upgrade Options depending on their classes and can combine multiple Upgrades during a match<br>Additionally, all units can get the \u201c+1 Max Momentum\u201d Upgrade, which may be necessary to reach the Momentum Cost of their most powerful skills.<br><br>Upgrades allow players to evolve their Squad during combat to adapt to different enemies and circumstances.<br>Upgrading any unit will make the next Upgrade more expensive for the whole Squad, so you have to be extra mindful of when and what to Upgrade.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2336810/extras/5t.png?t=1702245782\" /><br><br><br><u><strong>Highly Customizable Heroes</strong></u><br>Unique classes and skills system for Heroes designed from scratch.<br>Six main classes: Fighter, Rogue, Druid, Cleric, Necromancer and Wizard, with four subclasses each.
