    "about_the_game": "Step into the boots of Mateo Lombardo, an apprentice of the Rose Cross Order who finds himself the sole survivor of a vicious attack. You\u2019ll talk to many locals, collect items and weapons, solve puzzles, overcome challenging obstacles, and defeat a massive roster of bosses all while leveling up along the way. It is up to you to hunt and kill the infamous beast and unravel the mystery of it\u2019s origins. The next chapter in the Migami Monsterverse growls through the trees. Are you brave enough to face it? <br />\r\nChronicles of the Wolf is a new metroidvania, or \u201cmigavania\u201d game by Migami Games, the creators of the popular fangame, Castlevania The Lecarde Chronicles 1&amp;2, and the run and arrow medieval shooter, Wallachia: Reign of Dracula. <br />\r\nLike Wallachia, Chronicles of the Wolf leans on real history as inspiration, this time with the infamous case of The Beast of G\u00e9vaudan. The history tells of real attacks that occurred in Southern France between the years of 1764-1767 by a mysterious beast that gored and killed well over 100 people. In this new open world adventure, danger is always stalking you from the shadows.<br />\r\nWith a new soundtrack by Jeffrey Montoya and featuring new guest music from Oscar Araujo (the composer of the Castlevania Lords of Shadow series), and narration by Robert Belgrade (the voice of Alucard from Castlevania Symphony of the Night), Chronicles of the Wolf offers a fresh sound with some familiar touches for fans of the metroidvania genre along the way.",
