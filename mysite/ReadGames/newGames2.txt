about_the_game
The Christmas Demon Is HERE Every Christmas she breaks out of her icy tomb and goes hunting for blood. Unfortunately, you're her only target. Gameplay The House Stuck at home, use what you have around you to thrwart her attack! Perhaps you may lower the AC so low that she refreezes, or maybe you'll burn her to the ground. This map contains 12 unique endings! Some involve her death, some yours, and many more! Once you've proven your skill, you can unlock the nightmare mode. A much more challenging house map with randomized enemies, a stronger AI, and so much more. The nightmare mode is challenging, but so are your treasures at the end of each round. The School Much like the house, this time you're stuck at school after hours when she attacks. Perhaps you'll hide in a locker or knock her with a dodgeball. Maybe you'll find a way to scare her to death. This map also contains brand new endings and a nightmare mode! You can expect each round to last a few minutes, you'll be challenged with moving around, hunting her down, and solving puzzles all the way through. But thats not all... Every Christmas a new map (and more) will be released FOR FREE! Stay tuned!
